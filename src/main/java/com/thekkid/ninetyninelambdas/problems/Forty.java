/**
 * Goldbach's conjecture.
 * <p>
 * Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.
 * Example: 28 = 5 + 23.
 * <p>
 * It is one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved to be correct in the general case.
 * It has been numerically confirmed up to very large numbers (much larger than we can go with our Prolog system).
 * Write a predicate to find the two prime numbers that sum up to a given even integer.
